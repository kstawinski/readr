# Readr
It's an app that allows me to track and rate the books I've read. I do not buy physical copies, I borrow them from the library and using this application I am able to easily monitor the items I have read. I created it a bit for this reason to increase my reading motivation (it works for now :)).

*Currently, the application is only available in Polish üáµüá±*

I coded it in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), using [`carbon-components-svelte`](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-svelte) with [`carbon-icons-svelte`](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-icons-svelte) to create UI. My goal is for the application to be a fully functional PWA (f.e. offline mode).
